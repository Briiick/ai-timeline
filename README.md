## AI Timelines

In creating this project, I wanted to record the developments in AI from a fundamental news source, Hackernews.

See https://ai-timeline.web.app/ .

I felt like there were too many articles to click through every day, so I wanted to create a summary or historical record of those. And here's what it came to.

Hope you enjoy :)

This app was built using React, Google App Script, Google Sheets, OpenAI, and is hosted on Firebase.

I didn't want to pay to host this, hence using Google Sheets as the backend (cheeky).
